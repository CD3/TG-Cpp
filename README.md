# TG-Cpp
This is a C++ implementation of the Thompson-Gerstman thermal model (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8688838). The model
is based on the heating of melanin granules by laser light and includes the Arrhenius damage model.

This implementation was originally written by Austin Taylor Kane during a summer internship. It started as as a C++ port of a FORTRAN implementation and then
was redsigned to be be more modular. The final version completed by Mr. Kane
listed in the appendix of the technical report that can be found in the [doc directory](./doc).

The initial import here is a slightly modified version of the code listed in the technical report, but the modification are organizational only. The code implementing
the physics has not been changed.
